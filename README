PSP Drone Control
=================

PSP Drone Control (PSPDC) is a Parrot(tm) Bebop drone remote controller
software for PSP. Current features are:
- piloting
- configuring piloting drone settings
- flip
- blind photo record


Flight key binding
------------------

top:           move forward
down:          move backward
left:          move left
right:         move right
left-trigger:  turn left (yaw)
right-trigger: turn right (yaw)
cross:         increase altitude
square:        decrease altitude
circle:        emergency
triangle:      takeoff / landoff
select:        do flip
start:         main menu


Note about drone settings
-------------------------

- Flat trim command have no feedback yet, pressing X in its entry in the menu
send the command to drone. Just wait few seconds before fly.
- yes/no drone settings are synchronized when their values changed.
- numerical drone settings are synchronized when menu is closed.


Installing
---------

Copy EBOOT.PBP and DejaVuSans.ttf to 'PSP/GAME/pspdc' directory of the
PSP memory card.
DejaVuSans.ttf can be downloaded at: http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download

Note that you need a PSP which can run unsigned software.


Setup drone
-----------

There is currently an incompatibility between the PSP wifi stack and the
default Bebop firmware configuration so that the latter should be modified
in order to have the PSP connect to the drone.
For this step, you will need a computer with a wifi card and the telnet tool.
First connect the computer to the drone, you should have an IP like
192.168.42.2
When connected, run the following command:
$ telnet 192.168.42.1

You should see a busybox prompt.
We will modify the file configuring the Bebop wifi to switch the g-mode to LRS,
and so remount the root partition read-write.
$ mount -o remount,rw /
$ vi /sbin/broadcom_setup.sh

Insert following lines at the end of create_access_point() just before the
comment: "# Start Wifi"
bcmwl down
bcmwl gmode lrs
bcmwl up

Do the same in create_access_point_for_country().


Also makes sure the drone is blocked on the 2.4 GHz band, using official
application for instance, or by changing the config file on the drone.

You can now restart the drone and connect with your PSP.

Building from source
--------------------

To build pspdc, you will need the following tools and libraries:
* autoconf, automake and libtool
* a psptoolchain. Such toolchain can be build using the following scripts:
  https://github.com/pspdev/psptoolchain

* the following modified Parrot Bebop SDK:
  https://github.com/kradhub/libARSAL/tree/dev-build-psp
  https://github.com/kradhub/libARNetworkAL/tree/dev-psp-build2
  https://github.com/kradhub/libARNetwork/tree/dev-psp-build2
  https://github.com/kradhub/libARDiscovery/tree/dev-psp-build-branch
  https://github.com/kradhub/libARCommands/tree/dev-psp-build2

  See their respective README.PSP to know how to build them.

Then just go to the pspdc directory and run:
$ export PSPDEV=<path-to-psptoolchain-root>
$ export PATH=$PSPDEV/bin:$PSPDEV/psp/bin:$PATH
$ make

As a result of the compilation, you should have the EBOOT.PBP.
